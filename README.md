# mailcleaner
This is a script I have written for Google mail which automatically cleans the inbox. It deletes read emails if they haven't been moved to a folder.

To use it you must copy the script into a google script file and set a trigger for it. The trigger must be time based and run everyday.
The script will delete any mails that has been read and has not been sorted to a folder. If it should delete something you wanted to save, simply go to the trashcan and pull it out.

I cannot be held liable for any mails deleted.
